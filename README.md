# Product-Categorizer
In this assignment, you are expected to implement a categorizer class, namely ProductCategorizer, that takes in categorical data and maintains the categorical relationships such as parent-child and sibling relationships. ProductCategorizer will have two methods: def fill_tree(self): and def print_tree(self):. fill_tree will read categorical data from a text file and fill up an internally maintained general tree based on the structure that can be inferred from the data. The tree that will be used by ProductCategorizer will be an instance of LinkedTree, which you will implement in this assignment. The print_tree method will traverse the tree in a pre-order and post-order fashion and print the categorical data in a more proper way compared to the input file.
